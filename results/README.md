# Results

In my project, DANCE was used to filter molecules from the
[eMolecules](https://www.emolecules.com/info/plus/download-database) database.
This directory shows some results associated with the project. Note that on
GreenPlanet, the computing cluster the Mobley Lab uses, the eMolecules database
is divided into 9 sections, so much of the results here involve 9 sections.

## Manifest

- `output-histograms.pdf` - histograms showing the distribution of Wiberg bond
  orders around the trivalent nitrogen atom among molecules with one trivalent
  nitrogen in each part of the database - the combine distribution across all
  parts of the database is also shown
- `output-histograms-zoomed-in.pdf` - the same as `output-histograms.pdf`,
  except the bond orders are shown in the range 2.80 to 3.12 to make it easier
  to visualize the range where the most molecules were situated
